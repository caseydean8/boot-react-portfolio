        I build dynamic user experiences and robust applications for any of your
        web development needs, utilizing the most cutting edge technologies and
        frameworks as well as classic web architectures when necessary to bring
        your project to life. In my free time I enjoy gardening and hiking with
        my family in Northeast PA.
