      <p>
        I build dynamic user experiences and robust applications utilizing cutting edge technologies
        and frameworks as well as classic web architecture to bring software ideas to life. Solving
        problems is my passion but in my free time I enjoy gardening, hiking, and baking sourdough
        with my family in Northeast PA.
